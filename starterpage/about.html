			<h3>About David....</h3>
			<p>
				I was born long ago in a far away land (think Indiana minus all the cool effects). Back before computers were a thing, or the internet, or more than 3 channels on television. When good parents taught their children manners and being a good citizen. Yeah, that long ago.
			</p>
			<p>
				Was vaguely interested in these new "computer things". An IBM store opened in our local mall, so everytime I'd go there I would stop in and mash on some buttons and follow prompts on the screen until I got bored. My father told me to focus my attention elsewhere because "those things won't lead you anywhere good. You can't earn a living wage with those". Little did I know then.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finished high school 6 months earlier than anyone else, and joined the United States Air Force. I was in basic training before my classmates were even finished with school. Missed my senior prom and missed my graduation, as I was in technical school learning how to work on mulit-million fighter and bomber aircraft. Real knowledge that would help mold me.

				Moved to Europe, loved my new life. Moved back to US, got married, still serving our country. Was in a JCPenny store nad saw a computer on the closeout shelf. An Epson Apex XT computer and keyboard. Thats it. Price was $200. Sold! Got home, had no idea what to do. Through research without google or anything other than a <a href="http://www.computershopper.com/">ComputerShopper</a> magazine, I was able to find and purchase an EGA monitor. Later I had a 40MB hard drive installed in it for $320. That was the last time I paid anyone to do computer work for me.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since then I've built, from scratch, every other system I've owned. With this experience I was able to seperate from the USAF and start working as a computer systems engineer. I designed and built computers for a living. I've been doing that ever since. Now I work for a company that has several data centers throughout the nation, that I'm responsible for.
			</p>
			<p>
				During my early years as a systems engineer, I saw coworkers all talking about learning software. I had a choice. I figured with them all going to do software I'll stick with hardware and have less competition (I was young and thats my excuse). 
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout the years I've learned that nothing in technology is stagnant. Both hardware and software alike. As I've grown, I've felt remiss about passing a chance I had back then. I've wanted to learn the software side of computing for years, but never had direction. Online courses are plentiful now, and I'm going to take advantage of that. But with so much out there its difficult to know which way to face. So I am now looking into boot camps, online courses, e-books, podcasts, video podcasts. And so far I'm loving creating something from nothing. I'm doing this for me.

				Because for me, every step is a new beginning. And every step sheds a new light.
